# Cronjob_calculator
simple cronjob calculator using Python
Explanation:

Input: The script accepts a cron expression as input (e.g., */5 * * * *).

CronSlices Library: It checks if the cron expression is valid using the CronSlices.is_valid() function (from the python-crontab package).

Interpretation: Each part of the cron expression (minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week) is interpreted and translated into a human-readable format using the interpret_field function.

Human-readable output: The program prints out the schedule in a way that's easy to understand.
